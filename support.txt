Abstract Data Types:
Taking things by puting a semantic boundry beetween them. In prpose we can focus one side of
that semantic boundry to understand fully an completeness witout worring on the other side of the boundry.
So it's basically creating a semantic boundry beetween things.
exemple: if we want to use a stack data structure : 
the abstraction is in this ca is to focus on how to implement they operations on the stack to make it work.
instead of focusing wich can of data structure to use array or linked list... tohose part become the abstract
part. Because in either case both can be use to impleament Stack so we dont have to worry about it.
